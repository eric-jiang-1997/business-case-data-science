# business-case-data-science
This repo contains my projects in using data science methods to analyze business cases in areas of retail, healthcare, sports management, etc. The cases are provided by Professor H. Mehrizi from University of Waterloo, and the data is created only for academic purposes in course MSCI 719 (Operations Analytics). Please feel free to contact me via eric_jiang1997@outlook.com if you have any questions. Thanks!
